# Guess the Word (Python Game)

Guess the Word is an interactive Python game where the player tries to uncover a hidden secret word by guessing one letter at a time. The game reveals correct letters, tracks incorrect guesses, and ends when the player either completes the word or runs out of attempts. This project demonstrates Python fundamentals including loops, conditionals, functions, and string manipulation.

## 🎮 How the Game Works

1. The program selects or stores a secret word.
2. The player enters a letter guess.
3. Correct letters are revealed in their exact positions.
4. Incorrect guesses reduce the number of attempts remaining.
5. The game continues until:
   - The player guesses the full word → **WIN!**
   - Attempts reach zero → **LOSE**

## 🧠 Concepts Used

This project uses several core programming concepts:

- **While loops**  
- **Input validation**  
- **String slicing and concatenation**  
- **Functions with parameters and return values**  
- **Conditional logic (if/else)**  
- **Lists for tracking guesses**  
- **The `find()` method**  
- **Dynamic string updates**
